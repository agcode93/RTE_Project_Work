This repository contains the database dump of the project work "Route Table Engine" for Università Telematica Pegaso
An application model for the management of transportation routes with particular reference to road travel. 

The project structure is based on a relational database with conceptual references to graph theory and the GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) model, and is linked to issues discussed in literature such as the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). 

While maintaining a general and scalable vision, the model is configured in a concrete use case such as a travel agency that manages bus reservations and itineraries. 
This operational choice allows to verify in the field the flexibility and effectiveness of the system and extends its application as a potential tool for areas related to the sector such as logistics or supply chain, especially in cross-docking warehouse scenarios. 

Furthermore, a strategy for the optimization of routes is outlined also in function of the environmental impact, based on official data relating to CO₂ emissions provided by the European Parliament.
